select vs poll systemcall

 Select:

    Select system call monitors a fixed number of file descriptors.
    The number of file descriptors that can be monitored is limited by the constant FD_SETSIZE.
    It uses bitmasks to represent the file descriptor sets, which can be relatively expensive in terms of memory usage.
    It is well-suited for applications that need to monitor a small number of file descriptors.
    Select call can't work with file descriptor more than FD_SETSIZE.

Poll:

    Poll system call can monitor an arbitrary number of file descriptors.
    It uses an array of pollfd structures to represent the file descriptor sets, which is more efficient in terms of memory usage than select.
    It is well-suited for applications that need to monitor a large number of file descriptors.
    It can handle file descriptor more than FD_SETSIZE
